Javascript is an event driven and Object based language
Javascript will listen for events happening in the dom/browser and react based on that, hence the "event driven" part.
Everything is collected into 'Objects' in Javascript. 

Interpreted Language vs Compiled Language
compiled language will compile all your code and make sure it works before running it
Interpreted language will run the code even if it doesn't work as intended

dynamic typed vs static typed
you are allowed to change the type of the variable from string to boolian for example
in static languages you can not change types.
